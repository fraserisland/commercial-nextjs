        Collection of Personal Information

        Whenever you deal with Commercial 1 Gold Coast Pty Ltd, whether as a
        current or prospective seller, buyer, lessor or lessee, we will collect
        personal information in order to provide services to you. We do not
        collect personal information unless it is reasonably necessary for, or
        directly related to, one or more of the services we provide or functions
        we carry out.
      </h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        The types of personal information we generally collect include but is
        not limited to:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul className="pl-5">
        <li></li>
        <li>Date of birth.</li>

        <li>Mobile telephone number.</li>
        <li>Your occupation and business address.</li>
        <li>
          Financial information including details of your employer, income, name
          of bank or financial institution.
        </li>
        <li>
          Details of your spouse, de facto, dependent children, and roommates.
        </li>
        <li>Details of properties owned by you.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        We will not ordinarily ask you to provide sensitive information.
        However, there may be circumstances where the information provided by
        you reveals sensitive information. For example:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul className="pl-5">
        <li>
          You may require a property with particular features, such as
          wheelchair ramps. This may reveal health information.
        </li>
        <li>
          In providing details of your spouse or de facto partner, this may
          reveal sensitive information regarding your sexual orientation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>We will only collect sensitive information in circumstances where:</p>
      <br />
      <ul className="pl-5">
        <li>
          It is reasonably necessary for one or more of the services we provide
          or functions we carry out; and
        </li>
        <li>You consent to the collection of the information; or</li>
        <li>
          We are required or authorised by law to collect the sensitive
          information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        We will, if it is reasonable or practicable to do so, collect your
        personal information directly from you. This may happen when you fill
        out a form or when you give us personal information in person, or via
        telephone, email, correspondence or our website.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Sometimes we will collect personal information from a third party or a
        publicly available source. For example, we may need to collect personal
        information from a credit reporting agency, your legal adviser, your
        past or current employers, your previous lessors or property managers,
        and tenancy information services or databases.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If we receive personal information that we did not solicit, we will
        determine as soon as reasonably practicable whether we could have
        lawfully collected that information as part of our functions or
        activities. If we are not satisfied that we could have lawfully
        collected the information, then we will (if it is lawful and reasonable)
        destroy the information or ensure that it is de-identified.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You may choose to deal with us anonymously or under a pseudonym where
        lawful and practical. Where anonymity or use of a pseudonym will render
        us unable to provide the relevant service or do business, we may request
        that you identify yourself.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For example, whenever documents are to be submitted to government
        agencies or financial institutions, it is essential that we record your
        name accurately.

        Like many other businesses in Australia, Commercial 1 Gold Coast Pty Ltd
        may rely on third party suppliers or contractors to provide specialised
        services such as web hosting, cloud computing technology and data
        storage services, typing, call center. If personal information is
        provided to these suppliers and contractors in order to enable them to

        supplier or contractor handles the personal information in accordance
        with the Act and the Australian Privacy Principles. We will also require
        all suppliers and contractors to provide privacy undertakings and enter
        into confidentiality agreements.

        Accuracy of Personal Information
        <br />
        Commercial 1 Gold Coast Pty Ltd will take reasonable steps to ensure
        that all personal information it collects, uses or discloses is
        accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you believe your personal

        Security
        <br />
        Your personal information may be stored in hard copy documents or
        electronically. Commercial 1 Gold Coast Pty Ltd is committed to keeping
        your personal information secure and safe. Some of the ways we do this
        are:
      </h1>
      <br />
      <ul className="pl-5">
        <li>
          Requiring employees and contractors to enter into confidentiality
          agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secure hard copy document storage (i.e. storing hard copy documents in
          locked filing cabinets).
        </li>
        <li>Security measures for access to our computer systems.</li>
        <li>Providing a discreet environment for confidential discussions.</li>
        <li>Access control for our buildings.</li>
        <li>
          Security measures for our websites (see the{' '}
          <strong>Your Privacy on the Internet </strong>section for more
          information).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>We will review and update our security measures from time to time.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In addition, we will review the personal information and sensitive
        information held by us from time to time, ensuring that information
        which is no longer needed for a purpose for which it was initially
        collected is destroyed or de-identified.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>Your Privacy on the Internet</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        Commercial 1 Gold Coast Pty Ltd takes care to ensure that the
        information you provide to us via our website is protected. You may be
        able to access external websites by clicking on links we have provided.
        Those other websites are not subject to our privacy standards, policies
        and procedures. You will need to contact or review those websites
        directly to ascertain their privacy standards, policies and procedures.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h1>Access to Personal Information</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        You may request access to personal information that Commercial 1 Gold
        Coast Pty Ltd holds about you (see the Contacting Us section for more
        information).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We will acknowledge your request within seven (7) business days of the
        request being made. Access will usually be granted within seven (7)
        business days of our acknowledgment or, if the request involves complex
        considerations or voluminous photocopying or scanning, within fourteen
        (14) business days. We will let you know which timeframe applies to your
        request and if any delays are anticipated.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        You will need to verify your identity before access to your personal
        information is granted.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        While we cannot and do not charge an “application fee” for you applying
        to access your personal information, we may charge a fee for actually
        giving you access to your personal information in your preferred format
        (where reasonable and possible), which will cover our costs involved in
        locating and collating information as well as reproduction costs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Once your request has been processed by Commercial 1 Gold Coast Pty Ltd,
        you may be forwarded the information by mail or email or you may
        personally inspect it at the location where the information is held or
        another appropriate place. Whenever possible, we will endeavor to make
        the information available to you in the manner requested by you unless
        it is unreasonable for us to do so (e.g. if you have asked for the
        information to be emailed to you, we will endeavor to email the
        information to you. If the file size would be too large, we may send you
        the information by hard copy instead of email).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you are aware that we hold personal information about you that is no
        longer accurate, complete or up-to-date, please contact us (see the{' '}
        <strong>Contacting Us</strong> section for more information).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you request access to your personal information, or if you request
        that we correct your personal information, we will allow access or make
        the correction unless we consider that there is a sound reason to
        withhold the information, or not make the correction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Under the Act, we may refuse to grant access to personal information if:
      </p>
      <br />
      <ul className="pl-5">
        <li>
          We believe that granting access would pose a serious threat to the
          life, health or safety of any individual, or to public health or
          public safety.
        </li>
        <li>
          Granting access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of
          other individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Denial of access is required or authorised by law or by a Court or
          Tribunal order.
        </li>
        <li>Giving access would be unlawful.</li>
        <li>The request for access is frivolous or vexatious.</li>
        <li>
          Legal proceedings are underway or anticipated and the information
          would not be accessible by way of the discovery process in those
          proceedings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Giving access would reveal our intentions in relation to negotiations
          between us and you in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Giving access is likely to prejudice enforcement related activities
          conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body.
        </li>
        <li>
          Giving access is likely to prejudice action being taken or to be taken
          with respect to suspected unlawful activity or serious misconduct
          relating to our functions or activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Giving access would reveal information in connection with a
          commercially sensitive decision-making process.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        If we do not agree to make a correction to your personal information,
        you may provide a statement about the requested corrections, and we will
        ensure that the statement is apparent to any users of the relevant
        personal information.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If we do not agree to provide access to your personal information or to
        correct your personal information, we will provide written reasons for
        the refusal and the mechanisms available to complain about the refusal
        (see the <strong>Complaints</strong> section for more information).
